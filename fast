[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Updates one or more branches, tags, or other references in a remote repository from your local repository, and
       sends all necessary data that isn’t already on the remote.

       The simplest way to push is [1mgit push [4m[22m<remote>[24m [4m<branch>[24m. [1mgit push origin main [22mwill push the local [1mmain [22mbranch to
       the [1mmain [22mbranch on the remote named [1morigin[22m.

       The [4m<repository>[24m argument defaults to the upstream for the current branch, or [1morigin [22mif there’s no configured
       upstream.

       To decide which branches, tags, or other refs to push, Git uses (in order of precedence):

        1. The [4m<refspec>[24m argument(s) (for example [1mmain [22min [1mgit push origin main[22m) or the [1m--all[22m, [1m--mirror[22m, or [1m--tags[0m
           options

        2. The [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.push [22mconfiguration for the repository being pushed to

        3. The [1mpush.default [22mconfiguration. The default is [1mpush.default=simple[22m, which will push to a branch with the same
           name as the current branch. See the CONFIGURATION section below for more on [1mpush.default[22m.

       [1mgit push [22mmay fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch, depending on what [1mpush.default [22mis set
       to. See the UPSTREAM BRANCHES section below for more on how to set and use upstreams.

       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into it, by setting up [4mhooks[24m there.
       See documentation for [1mgit-receive-pack[22m(1).

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [4m<repository>[0m
           The "remote" repository that is the destination of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see
           the section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).

       [4m<refspec>[24m...
           Specify what destination ref to update with what source object.

           The format for a refspec is [[1m+[22m][4m<src>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<dst>[24m], for example [1mmain[22m, [1mmain:other[22m, or [1mHEAD^:refs/heads/main[22m.

           The [4m<src>[24m is often the name of the local branch to push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression" (see
           [1mgitrevisions[22m(7)).

           The [4m<dst>[24m determines what ref to update on the remote side. It must be the name of a branch, tag, or other
           ref, not an arbitrary expression.

           The [1m+ [22mis optional and does the same thing as [1m--force[22m.

           You can write a refspec using the fully expanded form (for example [1mrefs/heads/main:refs/heads/main[22m) which
           specifies the exact source and destination, or with a shorter form (for example [1mmain [22mor [1mmain:other[22m). Here are
           the rules for how refspecs are expanded, as well as various other special refspec forms:

           •   [4m<src>[24m without a [1m:[4m[22m<dst>[24m means to update the same ref as the [4m<src>[24m, unless the [1mremote.[4m[22m<repository>[24m[1m.push[0m
               configuration specifies a different [4m<dst>[24m. For example, if [1mmain [22mis a branch, then the refspec [1mmain[0m
               expands to [1mmain:refs/heads/main[22m.

           •   If [4m<dst>[24m unambiguously refers to a ref on the <repository> remote, then expand it to that ref. For
               example, if [1mv1.0 [22mis a tag on the remote, then [1mHEAD:v1.0 [22mexpands to [1mHEAD:refs/tags/v1.0[22m.

           •   If [4m<src>[24m resolves to a ref starting with [1mrefs/heads/ [22mor [1mrefs/tags/[22m, then prepend that to <dst>. For
               example, if [1mmain [22mis a branch, then [1mmain:other [22mexpands to [1mmain:refs/heads/other[0m

           •   The special refspec [1m: [22m(or [1m+: [22mto allow non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push "matching" branches:
               for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of the same name
               already exists on the remote side.

           •   [4m<src>[24m may contain a [1m* [22mto indicate a simple pattern match. This works like a glob that matches any ref
               matching the pattern. There must be only one [1m* [22min both the [4m<src>[24m and [4m<dst>[24m. It will map refs to the
               destination by replacing the * with the contents matched from the source. For example,
               [1mrefs/heads/*:refs/heads/* [22mwill push all branches.

           •   A refspec starting with [1m^ [22mis a negative refspec. This specifies refs to exclude. A ref will be considered
               to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does not match any negative refspec. Negative
               refspecs can be pattern refspecs. They must only contain a [4m<src>[24m. Fully spelled out hex object names are
               also not supported. For example, [1mgit push origin [22m'refs/heads/*' '^refs/heads/dev-*' will push all
               branches except for those starting with [1mdev-[0m

           •   If [4m<src>[24m is empty, it deletes the [4m<dst>[24m ref from the remote repository. For example, [1mgit push origin :dev[0m
               will delete the [1mdev [22mbranch.

           •   [1mtag [4m[22m<tag>[24m expands to [1mrefs/tags/[4m[22m<tag>[24m[1m:refs/tags/[4m[22m<tag>[24m. This is technically a special syntax for [1mgit push[0m
               and not a refspec, since in [1mgit push origin tag v1.0 [22mthe arguments [1mtag [22mand [1mv1.0 [22mare separate.

           •   If the refspec can’t be expanded unambiguously, error out with an error indicating what was tried, and
               depending on the [1madvice.pushUnqualifiedRefname [22mconfiguration (see [1mgit-config[22m(1)) suggest what refs/
               namespace you may have wanted to push to.

       Not all updates are allowed: see PUSH RULES below for the details.

       [1m--all[22m, [1m--branches[0m
           Push all branches (i.e. refs under [1mrefs/heads/[22m); cannot be used with other <refspec>.

       [1m--prune[0m
           Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart. For example a remote branch [1mtmp [22mwill be removed
           if a local branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g.  [1mgit push[0m
           [1m--prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/* [22mwould make sure that remote [1mrefs/tmp/foo [22mwill be removed if
           [1mrefs/heads/foo [22mdoesn’t exist.

       [1m--mirror[0m
           Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under [1mrefs/ [22m(which includes but is not limited to
           [1mrefs/heads/[22m, [1mrefs/remotes/[22m, and [1mrefs/tags/[22m) be mirrored to the remote repository. Newly created local refs
           will be pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and deleted
           refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the configuration option
           [1mremote.[4m[22m<remote>[24m[1m.mirror [22mis set.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--dry-run[0m
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       [1m--porcelain[0m
           Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for each ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout
           instead of stderr. The full symbolic names of the refs will be given.

       [1m-d[22m, [1m--delete[0m
           All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.

       [1m--tags[0m
           All refs under [1mrefs/tags [22mare pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.

       [1m--follow-tags[0m
           Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option, and also push annotated tags in [1mrefs/tags [22mthat
           are missing from the remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs being pushed.
           This can also be specified with configuration variable [1mpush.followTags[22m. For more information, see
           [1mpush.followTags [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       [1m--signed[22m, [1m--no-signed[22m, [1m--signed=[22m([1mtrue[22m|[1mfalse[22m|[1mif-asked[22m)
           GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or
           be logged. Possible values are:

           [1mfalse[22m, [1m--no-signed[0m
               no signing will be attempted.

           [1mtrue[22m, [1m--signed[0m
               the push will fail if the server does not support signed pushes.

           [1mif-asked[0m
               sign if and only if the server supports signed pushes. The push will also fail if the actual call to [1mgpg[0m
               [1m--sign [22mfails. See [1mgit-receive-pack[22m(1) for the details on the receiving end.

       [1m--atomic[22m, [1m--no-atomic[0m
           Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if available. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs
           are updated. If the server does not support atomic pushes the push will fail.

       [1m-o [4m[22m<option>[24m, [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[0m
           Transmit the given string to the server, which passes them to the pre-receive as well as the post-receive
           hook. The given string must not contain a [4mNUL[24m or [4mLF[24m character. When multiple [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m are
           given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line. When no
           [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m is given from the command line, the values of configuration variable [1mpush.pushOption[0m
           are used instead.

       [1m--receive-pack=[4m[22m<git-receive-pack>[24m, [1m--exec=[4m[22m<git-receive-pack>[0m
           Path to the [4mgit-receive-pack[24m program on the remote end. Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository
           over ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the default [1m$PATH[22m.

       [1m--force-with-lease[22m, [1m--no-force-with-lease[22m, [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m, [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<expect>[0m
           Usually, [1mgit push [22mrefuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite
           it.

           This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the remote ref is the expected value.  [1mgit[0m
           [1mpush [22mfails otherwise.

           Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published. You will have to bypass the "must
           fast-forward" rule in order to replace the history you originally published with the rebased history. If
           somebody else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing, the tip of the branch at the
           remote may advance with their commit, and blindly pushing with [1m--force [22mwill lose their work.

           This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are updating is what you rebased and want to
           replace. If the remote ref still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people did
           anything to the ref. It is like taking a "lease" on the ref without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref
           is updated only if the "lease" is still valid.

           [1m--force-with-lease [22malone, without specifying the details, will protect all remote refs that are going to be
           updated by requiring their current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for them.

           [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m, without specifying the expected value, will protect [4m<refname>[24m (alone), if it is
           going to be updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for
           it.

           [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<expect>[24m will protect [4m<refname>[24m (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
           requiring its current value to be the same as the specified value [4m<expect>[24m (which is allowed to be different
           from the remote-tracking branch we have for the refname, or we do not even have to have such a
           remote-tracking branch when this form is used). If [4m<expect>[24m is the empty string, then the named ref must not
           already exist.

           Note that all forms other than [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<expect>[24m that specifies the expected current
           value of the ref explicitly are still experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience with
           this feature.

           [1m--no-force-with-lease [22mwill cancel all the previous [1m--force-with-lease [22mon the command line.

           A general note on safety: supplying this option without an expected value, i.e. as [1m--force-with-lease [22mor
           [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs [1mgit fetch [22mon the remote
           to be pushed to in the background, e.g.  [1mgit fetch origin [22mon your repository in a cronjob.

           The protection it offers over [1m--force [22mis ensuring that subsequent changes your work wasn’t based on aren’t
           clobbered, but this is trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs in the background. We
           don’t have anything except the remote tracking info to go by as a heuristic for refs you’re expected to have
           seen & are willing to clobber.

           If your editor or some other system is running [1mgit fetch [22min the background for you a way to mitigate this is
           to simply set up another remote:

               git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
               git fetch origin-push

           Now when the background process runs [1mgit fetch origin [22mthe references on [1morigin-push [22mwon’t be updated, and
           thus commands like:

               git push --force-with-lease origin-push

           Will fail unless you manually run [1mgit fetch origin-push[22m. This method is of course entirely defeated by
           something that runs [1mgit fetch --all[22m, in that case you’d need to either disable it or do something more
           tedious like:

               git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
               git tag base master    # mark our base point
               git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
               git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master

           I.e. create a [1mbase [22mtag for versions of the upstream code that you’ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then
           rewrite history, and finally force push changes to [1mmaster [22mif the remote version is still at [1mbase[22m, regardless
           of what your local [1mremotes/origin/master [22mhas been updated to in the background.

           Alternatively, specifying [1m--force-if-includes [22mas an ancillary option along with
           [1m--force-with-lease[22m[[1m=[4m[22m<refname>[24m] (i.e., without saying what exact commit the ref on the remote side must be
           pointing at, or which refs on the remote side are being protected) at the time of "push" will verify if
           updates from the remote-tracking refs that may have been implicitly updated in the background are integrated
           locally before allowing a forced update.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--force[0m
           Usually, [1mgit push [22mwill refuse to update a branch that is not an ancestor of the commit being pushed.

           This flag disables that check, the other safety checks in PUSH RULES below, and the checks in
           [1m--force-with-lease[22m. It can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.

           Note that [1m--force [22mapplies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using it with [1mpush.default [22mset to [1mmatching[0m
           or with multiple push destinations configured with [1mremote.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.push [22mmay overwrite refs other than the
           current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind their remote counterpart). To force a push to
           only one branch, use a [1m+ [22min front of the refspec to push (e.g [1mgit push origin +master [22mto force a push to the

       [1m--force-if-includes[22m, [1m--no-force-if-includes[0m
           Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking ref has been integrated locally.

           This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the
           "reflog" entries of the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any updates from the
           remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the forced update if that is not the case.

           If the option is passed without specifying [1m--force-with-lease[22m, or specified along with
           [1m--force-with-lease=[4m[22m<refname>[24m[1m:[4m[22m<expect>[24m, it is a "no-op".

           Specifying [1m--no-force-if-includes [22mdisables this behavior.

       [1m--repo=[4m[22m<repository>[0m
           This option is equivalent to the [4m<repository>[24m argument. If both are specified, the command-line argument
           takes precedence.

           [1mcheck[0m
               Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed in the revisions to be pushed are available on at

[1mGIT URLS[0m
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path
       to the repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is
       inefficient and deprecated; do not use them).

       The native transport (i.e. [1mgit:// [22mURL) does no authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured
       networks.

       The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       •   [1mssh://[22m[[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mgit://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mhttp[22m[[1ms[22m][1m://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mftp[22m[[1ms[22m][1m://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       •   [[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[1m:/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first colon. This helps differentiate a local
       path that contains a colon. For example the local path [1mfoo:bar [22mcould be specified as an absolute path or
       [1m./foo:bar [22mto avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support [1m~[4m[22m<username>[24m expansion:

       •   [1mssh://[22m[[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [1mgit://[4m[22m<host>[24m[[1m:[4m[22m<port>[24m][1m/~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       •   [[4m<user>[24m[1m@[22m][4m<host>[24m[1m:~[4m[22m<user>[24m[1m/[4m[22m<path-to-git-repo>[0m

       For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be used:

       •   [1m/path/to/repo.git/[0m

       •   [1mfile:///path/to/repo.git/[0m

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies [1m--local [22moption. See [1mgit-[0m
       [1mclone[22m(1) for details.

       [1mgit clone[22m, [1mgit fetch [22mand [1mgit pull[22m, but not [1mgit push[22m, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See [1mgit-bundle[22m(1).

       When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use the [1mremote-[4m[22m<transport>[0m
       remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       •   [4m<transport>[24m[1m::[4m[22m<address>[0m

       where [4m<address>[24m may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific
       remote helper being invoked. See [1mgitremote-helpers[22m(7) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for
       them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration section
       of the form:

                   [url "[4m<actual-url-base>[24m"]
                           insteadOf = [4m<other-url-base>[0m

       For example, with this:

                   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:

       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL
       to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "[4m<actual-url-base>[24m"]
                           pushInsteadOf = [4m<other-url-base>[0m

       For example, with this:

                   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for
       pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.

[1mREMOTES[0m
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as [4m<repository>[24m argument:

       •   a remote in the Git configuration file: [1m$GIT_DIR/config[22m,

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes [22mdirectory, or

       •   a file in the [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mdirectory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line because they each contain a refspec which
       git will use by default.

   [1mNamed remote in configuration file[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously configured using [1mgit-remote[22m(1), [1mgit-[0m
       [1mconfig[22m(1) or even by a manual edit to the [1m$GIT_DIR/config [22mfile. The URL of this remote will be used to access the
       repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by default when you do not provide a refspec on the command
       line. The entry in the config file would appear like this:

                   [remote "<name>"]
                           url = <URL>
                           pushurl = <pushurl>
                           push = <refspec>
                           fetch = <refspec>

       The [4m<pushurl>[24m is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to [4m<URL>[24m. Pushing to a remote affects all
       defined pushurls or all defined urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch, however, will only fetch from the first
       defined url if multiple urls are defined.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/remotes[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/remotes[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access the
       repository. The refspec in this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on the command
       line. This file should have the following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL formats
                   Push: <refspec>
                   Pull: <refspec>

       [1mPush: [22mlines are used by [1mgit push [22mand [1mPull: [22mlines are used by [1mgit pull [22mand [1mgit fetch[22m. Multiple [1mPush: [22mand [1mPull:[0m
       lines may be specified for additional branch mappings.

   [1mNamed file in $GIT_DIR/branches[0m
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches[22m. The URL in this file will be used to access
       the repository. This file should have the following format:

                   <URL>#<head>

       [4m<URL>[24m is required; #[4m<head>[24m is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs, if you don’t provide one on the command
       line. [4m<branch>[24m is the name of this file in [1m$GIT_DIR/branches [22mand [4m<head>[24m defaults to [1mmaster[22m.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>

       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/<head>

[1mUPSTREAM BRANCHES[0m
       Branches in Git can optionally have an upstream remote branch. Git defaults to using the upstream branch for
       remote operations, for example:

       •   It’s the default for [1mgit pull [22mor [1mgit fetch [22mwith no arguments.

       •   It’s the default for [1mgit push [22mwith no arguments, with some exceptions. For example, you can use the
           [1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.pushRemote [22moption to push to a different remote than you pull from, and by default with
           [1mpush.default=simple [22mthe upstream branch you configure must have the same name.

       •   Various commands, including [1mgit checkout [22mand [1mgit status[22m, will show you how many commits have been added to
           your current branch and the upstream since you forked from it, for example "Your branch and [4morigin/main[24m have
           diverged, and have 2 and 3 different commits each respectively".

       The upstream is stored in [1m.git/config[22m, in the "[1mremote[22m" and "[1mmerge[22m" fields. For example, if [1mmain[22m's upstream is
       [1morigin/main[22m:

           [branch "main"]
              remote = origin
              merge = refs/heads/main

       You can set an upstream branch explicitly with [1mgit push --set-upstream [4m[22m<remote>[24m [4m<branch>[24m but Git will often
       automatically set the upstream for you, for example:

       •   When you clone a repository, Git will automatically set the upstream for the default branch.

       •   If you have the [1mpush.autoSetupRemote [22mconfiguration option set, [1mgit push [22mwill automatically set the upstream
           the first time you push a branch.

       •   Checking out a remote-tracking branch with [1mgit checkout [4m[22m<branch>[24m will automatically create a local branch
           with that name and set the upstream to the remote branch.

           [1mNote[0m

           Upstream branches are sometimes referred to as "tracking information", as in "set the branch’s tracking
           information".

[1mOUTPUT[0m
       The output of "git push" depends on the transport method used; this section describes the output when pushing
       over the Git protocol (either locally or via ssh).

       The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line representing the status of a single ref. Each
       line is of the form:

            <flag> <summary> <from> -> <to> (<reason>)

       If [1m--porcelain [22mis used, then each line of the output is of the form:

            <flag> \t <from>:<to> \t <summary> (<reason>)

       The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if [1m--porcelain [22mor [1m--verbose [22moption is used.

       [4m<flag>[0m
           A single character indicating the status of the ref:

           (space)
               for a successfully pushed fast-forward;

           [1m+[0m
               for a successful forced update;

           [1m-[0m
               for a successfully deleted ref;

           [1m*[0m
               for a successfully pushed new ref;

           !
               for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and

           [1m=[0m
               for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.

       [4m<summary>[0m
           For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and new values of the ref in a form suitable for
           using as an argument to [1mgit log [22m(this is [4m<old>[24m[1m..[4m[22m<new>[24m in most cases, and [4m<old>[24m[1m...[4m[22m<new>[24m for forced
           non-fast-forward updates).

           For a failed update, more details are given:

           rejected
               Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because it is not a fast-forward and you did not force
               the update.

           remote rejected
               The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a hook on the remote side, or because the remote
               repository has one of the following safety options in effect: [1mreceive.denyCurrentBranch [22m(for pushes to
               the checked out branch), [1mreceive.denyNonFastForwards [22m(for forced non-fast-forward updates),
               [1mreceive.denyDeletes [22mor [1mreceive.denyDeleteCurrent[22m. See [1mgit-config[22m(1).

           remote failure
               The remote end did not report the successful update of the ref, perhaps because of a temporary error on
               the remote side, a break in the network connection, or other transient error.

       from
           The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its [1mrefs/[4m[22m<type>[24m[1m/ [22mprefix. In the case of deletion, the name of
           the local ref is omitted.

       to
           The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its [1mrefs/[4m[22m<type>[24m[1m/ [22mprefix.

       reason
           A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully pushed refs, no explanation is needed. For a failed
           ref, the reason for failure is described.

[1mPUSH RULES[0m
       As a safety feature, the [1mgit push [22mcommand only allows certain kinds of updates to prevent you from accidentally
       losing data on the remote.

       Because branches and tags are intended to be used differently, the safety rules for pushing to a branch are
       different from the rules for pushing to a tag. In the following rules "update" means any modifications except
       deletions and creations. Deletions and creations are always allowed, except when forbidden by configuration or
       hooks.

        1. If the push destination is a [1mbranch [22m([1mrefs/heads/*[22m): only fast-forward updates are allowed, which means the
           destination must be an ancestor of the source commit. The source must be a commit.

        2. If the push destination is a [1mtag [22m([1mrefs/tags/*[22m): all updates will be rejected. The source can be any object.

        3. If the push destination is not a branch or tag:

           •   If the source is a tree or blob object, any updates will be rejected

           •   If the source is a tag or commit object, any fast-forward update is allowed, even in cases where what’s
               being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag object which happens to point to a new commit which is a
               fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or commit) it’s replacing. Replacing a tag with an entirely
               different tag is also allowed, if it points to the same commit, as well as pushing a peeled tag, i.e.
               pushing the commit that existing tag object points to, or a new tag object which an existing commit
               points to.

       You can override these rules by passing [1m--force [22mor by adding the optional leading [1m+ [22mto a refspec. The only
       exceptions are that no amount of forcing will make a branch accept a non-commit object, and forcing won’t make
       the remote repository accept a push that it’s configured to deny.

       Hooks and configuration can also override or amend these rules, see e.g. [1mreceive.denyNonFastForwards [22mand
       [1mreceive.denyDeletes [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1) and [1mpre-receive [22mand [1mupdate [22min [1mgithooks[22m(5).

[1mNOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS[0m
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to point at commit A to point at another
       commit B, it is called a fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.

       In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original commit A built on top of is a subset
       of the commits the new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.

       In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example, suppose you and somebody else started at
       the same commit X, and you built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history leading to
       commit A. The history looks like this:

                 B
                /
            ---X---A

       Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A back to the original repository from
       which you two obtained the original commit X.

       The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a
       fast-forward.

       But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now points at A) with commit B. This does [4mnot[0m
       fast-forward. If you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody will now start
       building on top of B.

       The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.

       If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work by the other person (history from X to A),
       you would need to first fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done by
       both parties, and push the result back.

       You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push" the result. A "git pull" will create a
       merge commit C between commits A and B.

                 B---C
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.

       Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A, with [1mgit pull --rebase[22m, and push the
       result back. The rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of A.

                 B   D
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.

       There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it
       is possible even when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit A yourself
       (in the first picture in this section), replace it with [1mgit commit --amend [22mto produce commit B, and you try to
       push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if you are certain that
       nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run [1mgit push[0m
       [1m--force [22mto overwrite it. In other words, [1mgit push --force [22mis a method reserved for a case where you do mean to
       lose history.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       [1mgit push[0m
           Works like [1mgit push [4m[22m<remote>[24m, where <remote> is the current branch’s remote (or [1morigin[22m, if no remote is
           configured for the current branch).

       [1mgit push origin[0m
           Without additional configuration, pushes the current branch to the configured upstream ([1mbranch.[4m[22m<name>[24m[1m.merge[0m
           configuration variable) if it has the same name as the current branch, and errors out without pushing
           otherwise.

           The default behavior of this command when no [4m<refspec>[24m is given can be configured by setting the [1mpush [22moption
           of the remote, or the [1mpush.default [22mconfiguration variable.

           For example, to default to pushing only the current branch to [1morigin [22muse [1mgit config remote.origin.push HEAD[22m.
           Any valid [4m<refspec>[24m (like the ones in the examples below) can be configured as the default for [1mgit push[0m
           [1morigin[22m.

       [1mgit push origin :[0m
           Push "matching" branches to [1morigin[22m. See [4m<refspec>[24m in the OPTIONS section above for a description of
           "matching" branches.

       [1mgit push origin master[0m
           Find a ref that matches [1mmaster [22min the source repository (most likely, it would find [1mrefs/heads/master[22m), and
           update the same ref (e.g.  [1mrefs/heads/master[22m) in [1morigin [22mrepository with it. If [1mmaster [22mdid not exist remotely,
           it would be created.

       [1mgit push origin HEAD[0m
           A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.

       [1mgit push mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev[0m
           Use the source ref that matches [1mmaster [22m(e.g.  [1mrefs/heads/master[22m) to update the ref that matches
           [1msatellite/master [22m(most probably [1mrefs/remotes/satellite/master[22m) in the [1mmothership [22mrepository; do the same for
           [1mdev [22mand [1msatellite/dev[22m.

           See the section describing [4m<refspec>[24m... above for a discussion of the matching semantics.

           This is to emulate [1mgit fetch [22mrun on the [1mmothership [22musing [1mgit push [22mthat is run in the opposite direction in
           order to integrate the work done on [1msatellite[22m, and is often necessary when you can only make connection in
           one way (i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership but mothership cannot initiate connection to satellite
           because the latter is behind a firewall or does not run sshd).

           After running this [1mgit push [22mon the [1msatellite [22mmachine, you would ssh into the [1mmothership [22mand run [1mgit merge[0m
           there to complete the emulation of [1mgit pull [22mthat were run on [1mmothership [22mto pull changes made on [1msatellite[22m.

       [1mgit push origin HEAD:master[0m
           Push the current branch to the remote ref matching [1mmaster [22min the [1morigin [22mrepository. This form is convenient
           to push the current branch without thinking about its local name.

       [1mgit push origin master:refs/heads/experimental[0m
           Create the branch [1mexperimental [22min the [1morigin [22mrepository by copying the current [1mmaster [22mbranch. This form is
           only needed to create a new branch or tag in the remote repository when the local name and the remote name
           are different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.

       [1mgit push origin :experimental[0m
           Find a ref that matches [1mexperimental [22min the [1morigin [22mrepository (e.g.  [1mrefs/heads/experimental[22m), and delete it.

       [1mgit push origin +dev:master[0m
           Update the origin repository’s master branch with the dev branch, allowing non-fast-forward updates.  [1mThis[0m
           [1mcan leave unreferenced commits dangling in the origin repository.  [22mConsider the following situation, where a
           fast-forward is not possible:

                           o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                    \
                                     X---Y---Z  dev

           The above command would change the origin repository to

                                     A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                    /
                           o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master

           Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic name, and so would be unreachable. As
           such, these commits would be removed by a [1mgit gc [22mcommand on the origin repository.

[1mSECURITY[0m
       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository
       that was not intended to be shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer, your
       best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to both clients and servers. In particular,
       namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
       namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be
           shared but can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object ID
           X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to send the content of X because the victim already has
           it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the attacker
           later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in
           the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
           on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user does additional work on this branch
           and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker
           already has, and the attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against X.
           The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.

[1mCONFIGURATION[0m
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the [1mgit-config[22m(1) documentation. The
       content is the same as what’s found there:

       [1mpush.autoSetupRemote[0m
           If set to [1mtrue [22massume [1m--set-upstream [22mon default push when no upstream tracking exists for the current branch;
           this option takes effect with [1mpush.default [22moptions [1msimple[22m, [1mupstream[22m, and [1mcurrent[22m. It is useful if by default
           you want new branches to be pushed to the default remote (like the behavior of [1mpush.default=current[22m) and you
           also want the upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to benefit from this option are [1msimple[0m
           central workflows where all branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.

       [1mpush.default[0m
           Defines the action [1mgit push [22mshould take if no refspec is given (whether from the command-line, config, or
           elsewhere). Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a purely central
           workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push destination), [1mupstream [22mis probably what you want.
           Possible values are:

           [1mnothing[0m
               do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is given. This is primarily meant for people who want
               to avoid mistakes by always being explicit.

           [1mcurrent[0m
               push the current branch to update a branch with the same name on the receiving end. Works in both central
               and non-central workflows.

           [1mupstream[0m
               push the current branch back to the branch whose changes are usually integrated into the current branch
               (which is called [1m@[22m{upstream}). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing to the same repository you
               would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).

           [1mtracking[0m
               this is a deprecated synonym for [1mupstream[22m.

           [1msimple[0m
               push the current branch with the same name on the remote.

               If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same repository you pull from, which is
               typically [1morigin[22m), then you need to configure an upstream branch with the same name.

               This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited for beginners.

           [1mmatching[0m
               push all branches having the same name on both ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to
               remember the set of branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push [1mmaint [22mand [1mmaster [22mthere and
               no other branches, the repository you push to will have these two branches, and your local [1mmaint [22mand
               [1mmaster [22mwill be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure [4mall[24m the branches you would push out are ready to be
               pushed out before running [1mgit push[22m, as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of the
               branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and push out the result, while other
               branches are unfinished, this mode is not for you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing into a
               shared central repository, as other people may add new branches there, or update the tip of existing
               branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 ([1msimple [22mis the new default).

       [1mpush.followTags[0m
           If set to true, enable [1m--follow-tags [22moption by default. You may override this configuration at time of push
           by specifying [1m--no-follow-tags[22m.

       [1mpush.gpgSign[0m
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string [1mif-asked[22m. A true value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if
           [1m--signed [22mis passed to [1mgit-push[22m(1). The string [1mif-asked [22mcauses pushes to be signed if the server supports it,
           as if [1m--signed=if-asked [22mis passed to [1mgit push[22m. A false value may override a value from a lower-priority
           config file. An explicit command-line flag always overrides this config option.

       [1mpush.pushOption[0m
           When no [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m argument is given from the command line, [1mgit push [22mbehaves as if each [4m<option>[0m
           of this variable is given as [1m--push-option=[4m[22m<option>[24m.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a higher priority configuration file (e.g.
           [1m.git/config [22min a repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority configuration files (e.g.
           [1m$HOME/.gitconfig[22m).

               Example:

               /etc/gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = a
                 push.pushoption = b

               ~/.gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = c

               repo/.git/config
                 push.pushoption =
                 push.pushoption = b

               This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).

       [1mpush.recurseSubmodules[0m
           May be [1mcheck[22m, [1mon-demand[22m, [1monly[22m, or [1mno[22m, with the same behavior as that of [1mpush --recurse-submodules[22m. If not
           set, [1mno [22mis used by default, unless [1msubmodule.recurse [22mis set (in which case a [1mtrue [22mvalue means [1mon-demand[22m).

       [1mpush.useForceIfIncludes[0m
           If set to [1mtrue[22m, it is equivalent to specifying [1m--force-if-includes [22mas an option to [1mgit-push[22m(1) in the command
           line. Adding [1m--no-force-if-includes [22mat the time of push overrides this configuration setting.

           and the server attempt to find commits in common. If [1mfalse[22m, Git will rely solely on the server’s ref
           advertisement to find commits in common.

       [1mpush.useBitmaps[0m
